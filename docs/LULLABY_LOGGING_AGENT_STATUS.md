# Lullaby Logging Agent Status

AUTOPILOT_STATUS: RUNNING

## Source of truth

- `docs/LULLABY_LOGGING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_EN.md`
- `docs/LULLABY_LOGGING_MVP_AUDIT.md` (Phase 0 audit output — read before refactoring)

## Current phase

Phase 1.2 — Repository/service layer complete (`LoggingRepository` interface +
`LoggingRepositoryImpl` over an injectable persistence port, `LegacyLoggingMapper`,
and the `loggingV2` feature flag). Next: Phase 1.3 store (`loggingStore` with the
`activeSleep`/`activeBreastFeed`/`activePump` slots, hydration, foreground
reconcile) and the timestamp-based timer helpers (`useElapsedTime`/`sessionMath`)
— status task 04 "active session model".

## Completed tasks

- **00 + 01 — Audit existing MVP (one logical "audit" unit).** Mapped the full
  stack, navigation/providers, the single `TonightState { events, orbView }`
  store, every Feed/Sleep/Diaper/Pump/Note creation path, active-timer storage,
  local + Supabase storage keys/payloads, timeline dependencies, and the
  field-by-field mapping to the target `CareEvent` model. Confirmed there is no
  analytics, no notifications, and no feature-flag system. Wrote
  `docs/LULLABY_LOGGING_MVP_AUDIT.md` with a prioritized gap analysis. No app
  code changed (docs-only).
- **02 — Shared logging event model (Phase 1.1).** Added the `src/features/logging`
  module BESIDE the legacy `LogEvent` (nothing wired into the app yet):
  - `domain/types.ts` — the discriminated `CareEvent` union
    (`BreastFeedEvent` / `BottleFeedEvent` / `SleepEvent` / `DiaperEvent` /
    `PumpEvent`) on `CareEventBase`, plus `BreastSideSegment`, `PumpVolumeDraft`,
    `UndoableMutation`, alias unions (sides/kinds/milk/sleep type), and type
    guards (`isBreastFeed`, `isBottleFeed`, `isSleepEvent`, `isDiaperEvent`,
    `isPumpEvent`, `isActiveSession`).
  - `domain/ids.ts` — `newUuid()` (v4, prefers `crypto.randomUUID`, Math.random
    fallback) and `newClientEventId()` for idempotent retries.
  - `domain/errors.ts` — serializable `LoggingError` + `loggingError()` factory.
  - `domain/rules.ts` — the five plan validators (`validateBottleAmount`,
    `validateSessionRange` with optional future-start guard, `validateBreastSegments`,
    `validatePumpVolumes`, `validateDiaperKind`) returning `ValidationResult`
    (no throws — errors flow into store state per plan §6).
  - `timer/clock.ts` — `Clock` + `systemClock` + `createManualClock()` (fake clock
    for session tests, plan §11.1).
  - `index.ts` — public-API barrel (plan §2.3).
  - Extended the smoke test with 10 checks (U1–U10) covering the clock, ids,
    every validator branch, and guard narrowing → suite now 70/70.
- **03 — Repository/service layer (Phase 1.2).** Added the `loggingV2` feature
  flag and the data layer, still additive (nothing wired into the running app):
  - `config/featureFlags.ts` — `isLoggingV2Enabled()` (runtime override →
    `EXPO_PUBLIC_LOGGING_V2` env → `false` default), `setLoggingV2Enabled`,
    `resolveLoggingFlags`, `resetLoggingFlags`.
  - `data/LoggingRepository.ts` — the plan §5 interface (`getTodayEvents`,
    `getActiveSessions`, `createEvent`, `updateEvent`, `softDeleteEvent`,
    `enqueueSync`) + `TodayEventsQuery`/`ActiveSessionsQuery`.
  - `data/loggingPersistence.ts` — pure (Node-safe) `LoggingPersistencePort`,
    `LoggingSnapshot`, serialize/parse with per-row structural validation,
    `LOGGING_STORAGE_KEY = lullaby/logging-v2/v1`, and an in-memory port for tests.
  - `data/LoggingRepositoryImpl.ts` — `createLoggingRepository(port, clock)`:
    idempotent create by `clientEventId`, `version`/`updatedAt` stamping on
    update, soft-delete, today-window read (same local day, newest first, excl.
    deleted/cancelled), active-session read (sleep/breast by child, pump by
    caregiver). No ticking counter persisted (plan §5).
  - `data/LegacyLoggingMapper.ts` — `legacyEventToCareEvent` /  `mapLegacyEvents`
    (forward, per audit §10; notes → null) + best-effort `careEventToLegacyEvent`
    reverse skeleton for the eventual migration write-path.
  - `data/loggingStorage.ts` — the device-only AsyncStorage port +
    `createDeviceLoggingRepository()`; kept OUT of the barrel so `index.ts` stays
    Node-runnable.
  - Extended the smoke test with 9 checks (V1–V9) → suite now **79/79**.

## Current task

04. Add the active-session model + timestamp-based timer helpers (plan Phase 1.3
store + §6 / Phase 4 session engine). Introduce the logging store/state with
distinct `activeSleep` / `activeBreastFeed` / `activePump` slots (the audit's
central gap: one `orbView` cannot model concurrent sessions), hydrate it from the
repository on launch, reconcile on foreground, and add the display-only
`useElapsedTime` hook + `sessionMath` that recompute elapsed time as
`now - startedAt` (never a persisted counter). Build on the task-03 repository.

## Decisions made

- Treated audit tasks 00 and 01 as a single logical "audit" run, delivered as one
  document, because they are two halves of the same Phase 0 audit.
- **Refactor in place, don't rewrite.** The MVP's pure-logic + thin-React +
  `EventRepository` boundary is a good fit for the plan's layering; we extend it.
- Keep the existing `LogEvent`/`note` type as an out-of-scope extension; the new
  union targets feed/sleep/diaper/pump only.
- New model fields can land without a destructive Supabase migration: `events.id`
  is `text` and `events.meta` is JSONB.
- `loggingV2` feature flag will be introduced when the new domain module is
  created (task 02+), not during the audit.
- **Task 02 was kept to the pure domain model only** (types + clock + ids +
  validators + errors). The `loggingV2` flag and the repository were deliberately
  deferred to task 03 so each run stays one logical unit; the new module is not
  imported by the app yet, so the running MVP is untouched.
- Validators **return** `ValidationResult` rather than throwing, so the
  application/store layer can surface a recover/error state (plan §6) instead of
  crashing on bad input.
- Added small sanity caps (`BOTTLE_MAX_ML = 4000`, `PUMP_MAX_ML = 2000`) as
  garbage filters, not product limits, alongside the plan's explicit "> 0" rules.
- **Task 03 stores v2 events under their OWN key** (`lullaby/logging-v2/v1`)
  through an injectable `LoggingPersistencePort`, NOT inside the legacy
  `lullaby/local-events/v1` store. Writing `CareEvent`s into the legacy store
  would break its strict `LogEvent` validation and is the destructive move the
  plan forbids until migration is verified (§2.4). "Connect the existing local
  storage/API" is satisfied by (a) reusing the same AsyncStorage mechanism with
  the same defensive load/validate/silent-fail discipline as `localStorage.ts`,
  and (b) the `LegacyLoggingMapper` adapting existing `LogEvent` data into
  `CareEvent` so the v2 timeline can read old rows.
- **Did NOT wire the v2 repository into the live Supabase path.** That needs the
  `version`/`clientEventId`/`subjectUserId` columns and conflict handling the plan
  defers to PR 9; doing it now would risk the running MVP. The repository hides
  storage behind the port so the Supabase backing can be added later without
  changing the contract.
- **The repository owns data-layer concerns:** idempotent create by
  `clientEventId` (retry-safe, plan §9), `version` bump + `updatedAt` stamp on
  update/soft-delete (via the injected `Clock`), and soft-delete instead of hard
  remove (plan §8). Business validators/use-cases stay in the application layer.
- **`familyId` mirrors the baby scope** in the mapper for now (audit §13 open
  question) via an overridable `resolveFamilyId` hook.
- **The barrel (`index.ts`) stays Node-runnable:** it re-exports the RN-free data
  layer + flag but NOT `loggingStorage.ts` (AsyncStorage). Device callers import
  that file directly, mirroring how `localRepository` imports `localStorage`.

## Known issues (found during audit, to fix in later tasks)

- **Sleep finish is hardcoded to +72 min** (`SLEEP_FINALIZE_MIN` /
  `endRunningSleep`, `src/data/mock.ts:214,354`) instead of `endedAt = now`.
  Highest-priority behavioral fix for the Sleep flow (task 06).
- No independent sessions: a single `orbView` cannot model concurrent
  sleep + pump (needed by plan Phase 4).
- No `useElapsedTime` ticking hook and no `AppState` foreground reconciliation
  (plan §6 / Phase 4).
- Diaper has no `dry`; quick-log is 3 taps, not 2. Pump drops `both` and captures
  no volume. Bottle captures no volume/milk type. Breast has no real timers or
  side segments.
- Undo is delete-newest only (no `UndoableMutation` snapshot / undo-finish).

## Last verification

- 2026-06-21 (task 03) — `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0. `npm run
  check:local-interactions` → **all 79 checks pass** (70 prior + 9 new, V1–V9,
  for the repository/mapper/persistence/flag). `npm run lint` (`expo lint`) →
  exit 0, clean. `npm test` still not available (no runner; the extended smoke
  test is the substitute). The new data layer is additive and unreferenced by the
  app (barrel stays Node-safe; device storage imported directly), so MVP behavior
  is unchanged.
- 2026-06-21 (task 02) — `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0 (no `typecheck` script;
  `tsc` used directly). `npm run check:local-interactions` → **all 70 checks
  pass** (60 legacy + 10 new for the logging v2 foundation). `npm run lint`
  (`expo lint`) → clean. `npm test` still not available (no runner; the smoke
  test is the substitute and was extended for the new code). The new module is
  additive and unreferenced by the app, so MVP behavior is unchanged.

## Final result

Not finished.

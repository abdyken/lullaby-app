# Lullaby Logging Agent Status

AUTOPILOT_STATUS: RUNNING

## Source of truth

- `docs/LULLABY_LOGGING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_EN.md`
- `docs/LULLABY_LOGGING_MVP_AUDIT.md` (Phase 0 audit output — read before refactoring)

## Current phase

Phase 1.1 — Domain foundation complete (CareEvent model + Clock + ids +
validators). Next: Phase 1.2 repository (`LoggingRepository` interface + impl
over the existing local/Supabase boundary) and the `loggingV2` feature flag.

## Task queue

- [x] 00. Audit existing MVP structure
- [x] 01. Identify current navigation, state management, storage, and logging code
- [x] 02. Create or adapt shared logging event TypeScript models
- [ ] 03. Create logging repository/service layer
- [ ] 04. Add active session model for timestamp-based timers
- [ ] 05. Implement Feed flow: breast + bottle
- [ ] 06. Implement Sleep flow: start/stop session
- [ ] 07. Implement Diaper quick-log flow
- [ ] 08. Implement Pump flow: side + timer + optional volume
- [ ] 09. Integrate all events into Today timeline
- [ ] 10. Add Undo behavior
- [ ] 11. Add active session recovery after app restart
- [ ] 12. Add validation and edge-case handling
- [ ] 13. Add or update tests
- [ ] 14. Run final verification
- [ ] 15. Final cleanup and implementation summary

## Completed tasks

- **00 + 01 — Audit existing MVP (one logical "audit" unit).** Mapped the full
  stack, navigation/providers, the single `TonightState { events, orbView }`
  store, every Feed/Sleep/Diaper/Pump/Note creation path, active-timer storage,
  local + Supabase storage keys/payloads, timeline dependencies, and the
  field-by-field mapping to the target `CareEvent` model. Confirmed there is no
  analytics, no notifications, and no feature-flag system. Wrote
  `docs/LULLABY_LOGGING_MVP_AUDIT.md` with a prioritized gap analysis. No app
  code changed (docs-only).
- **02 — Shared logging event model (Phase 1.1).** Added the `src/features/logging`
  module BESIDE the legacy `LogEvent` (nothing wired into the app yet):
  - `domain/types.ts` — the discriminated `CareEvent` union
    (`BreastFeedEvent` / `BottleFeedEvent` / `SleepEvent` / `DiaperEvent` /
    `PumpEvent`) on `CareEventBase`, plus `BreastSideSegment`, `PumpVolumeDraft`,
    `UndoableMutation`, alias unions (sides/kinds/milk/sleep type), and type
    guards (`isBreastFeed`, `isBottleFeed`, `isSleepEvent`, `isDiaperEvent`,
    `isPumpEvent`, `isActiveSession`).
  - `domain/ids.ts` — `newUuid()` (v4, prefers `crypto.randomUUID`, Math.random
    fallback) and `newClientEventId()` for idempotent retries.
  - `domain/errors.ts` — serializable `LoggingError` + `loggingError()` factory.
  - `domain/rules.ts` — the five plan validators (`validateBottleAmount`,
    `validateSessionRange` with optional future-start guard, `validateBreastSegments`,
    `validatePumpVolumes`, `validateDiaperKind`) returning `ValidationResult`
    (no throws — errors flow into store state per plan §6).
  - `timer/clock.ts` — `Clock` + `systemClock` + `createManualClock()` (fake clock
    for session tests, plan §11.1).
  - `index.ts` — public-API barrel (plan §2.3).
  - Extended the smoke test with 10 checks (U1–U10) covering the clock, ids,
    every validator branch, and guard narrowing → suite now 70/70.

## Current task

03. Create the logging repository/service layer (plan Phase 1.2) — define the
`LoggingRepository` interface (§5) and a `LoggingRepositoryImpl` that adapts the
existing local AsyncStorage + Supabase `EventRepository` boundary, mapping
`CareEvent` ↔ rows via a `LegacyLoggingMapper` skeleton. Introduce the
`loggingV2` feature flag here (deferred from task 02 on purpose — see Decisions).
Implement create / update / soft-delete, read-today, and read-active-sessions.

## Decisions made

- Treated audit tasks 00 and 01 as a single logical "audit" run, delivered as one
  document, because they are two halves of the same Phase 0 audit.
- **Refactor in place, don't rewrite.** The MVP's pure-logic + thin-React +
  `EventRepository` boundary is a good fit for the plan's layering; we extend it.
- Keep the existing `LogEvent`/`note` type as an out-of-scope extension; the new
  union targets feed/sleep/diaper/pump only.
- New model fields can land without a destructive Supabase migration: `events.id`
  is `text` and `events.meta` is JSONB.
- `loggingV2` feature flag will be introduced when the new domain module is
  created (task 02+), not during the audit.
- **Task 02 was kept to the pure domain model only** (types + clock + ids +
  validators + errors). The `loggingV2` flag and the repository were deliberately
  deferred to task 03 so each run stays one logical unit; the new module is not
  imported by the app yet, so the running MVP is untouched.
- Validators **return** `ValidationResult` rather than throwing, so the
  application/store layer can surface a recover/error state (plan §6) instead of
  crashing on bad input.
- Added small sanity caps (`BOTTLE_MAX_ML = 4000`, `PUMP_MAX_ML = 2000`) as
  garbage filters, not product limits, alongside the plan's explicit "> 0" rules.

## Known issues (found during audit, to fix in later tasks)

- **Sleep finish is hardcoded to +72 min** (`SLEEP_FINALIZE_MIN` /
  `endRunningSleep`, `src/data/mock.ts:214,354`) instead of `endedAt = now`.
  Highest-priority behavioral fix for the Sleep flow (task 06).
- No independent sessions: a single `orbView` cannot model concurrent
  sleep + pump (needed by plan Phase 4).
- No `useElapsedTime` ticking hook and no `AppState` foreground reconciliation
  (plan §6 / Phase 4).
- Diaper has no `dry`; quick-log is 3 taps, not 2. Pump drops `both` and captures
  no volume. Bottle captures no volume/milk type. Breast has no real timers or
  side segments.
- Undo is delete-newest only (no `UndoableMutation` snapshot / undo-finish).

## Last verification

- 2026-06-21 (task 02) — `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0 (no `typecheck` script;
  `tsc` used directly). `npm run check:local-interactions` → **all 70 checks
  pass** (60 legacy + 10 new for the logging v2 foundation). `npm run lint`
  (`expo lint`) → clean. `npm test` still not available (no runner; the smoke
  test is the substitute and was extended for the new code). The new module is
  additive and unreferenced by the app, so MVP behavior is unchanged.

## Final result

Not finished.
